  "description" : "Activate a series of inputs\n\nSet given inputs (1-255) of the controllers general purpose I/O to either true or false. This command was introduced due to coordination requirements needing to set many inputs to true/false at the same time and M0006 being to slow to send a message for each input individually. With this command many inputs can be set to true/false at the same time using a single command message. It can be used for all types of input where the traffic light controller must react to external control. Typical usages are bus priority, coordination between traffic controllers, external control systems, and much more.\n\nRequires security code 2.\n\nThe parameter ‘status’ sets/unsets a block of 16 inputs at a time. It can be repeated to set several blocks of 16 inputs. Values are separated with comma. Blocks are separated with semicolon. Format: [Offset];[Bits to set];[Bits to unset];…\n\n- ‘Offset’ defines where the 16 inputs starts from\n- ‘Bits to set’ defines which bit(s) to set. ‘0’ if unused\n- ‘Bits to unset’ defines which bit(s) to unset. ‘0’ if unused\n\nExample 1:\n“3,4134,65” sets input 4,5,8,15 and unsets 3,9\n- Input starts from no. 5\n- “4134” is 1 0000 0010 0110 in binary, but since input starts from 3, it is shifted 3 bits, e.g. 1000 0001 0011 0000 which are bits 4,5,8,15\n- “65” is 100 0001 in binary, but since input starts from 3, it is shifted 3 bits, e.g. 10 0000 1000 which are bits 3,9\n\nExample 2:\n“12,1,4” sets input 12 and unsets 14\n- Input starts from no. 12\n- “1” is 1 in binary, but since input starts at 12 it is shifted 12 bits, e.g. 1 0000 0000 0000, which is bit 12\n- “4” is 100 in binary, but since input starts at 12 it is shifted 12 bits, e.g. 100 0000 0000 0000, which is bit 14\n\nAnd both these examples could be sent in the same message as: “3,4143,65;12,1,4”\n\nSuch a message would set input 4,5,8,12,15 and unset input 3,9,14\n\nExample 3:\n“0,1,2” sets input 0 and unsets 1\n- Input starts from 0\n- “1” is 1 in binary, which is bit 0\n- “2” is 10 in binary, which is bit 1",
