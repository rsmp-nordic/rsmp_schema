It is reserved in the SXL for possible future use.\nIntended for use with coordination of signaling systems where a traffic light controller communicates with neighboring controllers.\nOnly used when a primary controller orders signal group of other controller to green or red (Coordination with external control bits).\nMay also include purposes for adaptive control where a UTC system or a local traffic light controller takes over the phase control (stage control).\nRequires security code 2.",
